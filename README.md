MenuPlaner is a new Solution for a ingredients and recipe database.
The project helps people with a food allergie to categories their ingredients and recipes.

The Solution contains three projects:
A xamarin.android project for the frontend, a .NET Standard project for central components and an .NET Core API for the serverlogic.

I made this OpenSource Project for my thesis at the https://www.zbw.ch/.
